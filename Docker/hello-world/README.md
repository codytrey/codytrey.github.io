# Baby's first Container

First take a look at your Docker environment:
To see the images downloaded to you system run:

```bash
    ~$ docker images (There should be none)
```

Very minimal example of a Docker container:

```bash
    ~$ docker run hello-world
```

Now run the `docker images` command again, you should see that it automatically downloaded the necessary image.
